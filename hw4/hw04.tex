\homework{4}{by Lambert Leong}

\textbf{Problem 1}
%https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-maximum-likelihood-and-cross-entropy-as-a-loss-function
%https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/364216/the-relationship-between-maximizing-the-likelihood-and-minimizing-the-cross-entro

\\
\\Maximizing the conditional likelihood of the data.
 \begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})=p_{\theta}(y_{n}|x_{n})& = \prod_{n}^{N}(\hat{y})^y(1-\hat{y})^{1-y} \\
 	&= \sum_{n}^{N}log(\hat{y})+(1-y)log(1-\hat{y})
 \end{align*}

\textbf{Problem 2}
\begin{enumerate}[labelindent=0pt]
\item
Sample size is large enough to do a 60\%, 20\%, 20\% split for train,
validation, and test.
\item
The exact architecture or neural net model is ambiguous.
\item
The loss function being optimized is not clear.
\item
The exact hyper parameters optimized are not stated.
\item
The evaluation method for the competition is unclear(i.e. are they using AUROC,
AUPRC, or etc).
\item
It seems as though the test set was not used.  The individual does not report
how the tuned model did on the test set. 
\item
It is unclear if the individual is first place on the leader board of if they
acutally won the whole competition.
\item
The final optimized parameters are not reported which makes it difficult to
reproduce the work.
\item
It is not clear what data set was used to train the final model that was
submitted.  Did the individual use just the model trained on the 80\% training
data or all the training data? 
\item
The final test set, mentioned in the last line, is ambiguous because it could be
referring to the witheld dataset that is used to pick the winners or the final
test set(10\% of the training) that the individual set aside when he did his data split.
