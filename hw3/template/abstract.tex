\begin{abstract}
Integrated 3D multichip systems consist of multiple microprocessor chips
stacked together in some layout configuration.  Stacking chips together allows
for many chips to be contained with in a single system which affords that system
great computational power and it is beneficial for the running of parallel
applications.  Physical constraints as well as the avoidance of communication
interference that can occur with wireless inter-chip communication presents
network design challenges.  A genetic algorithm was used to explore different
designs in an attempt to achieve the best network inter-chip topology that
complies with the physical constraints. The genetic algorithm was successful and
layouts were generated with comparable network characteristics to a previously
proposed layout known as the checkerboard. %this work is a step towards the heat
%and power optimization but ...
